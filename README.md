## Random thoughts
- building a static version [of a React component] requires a lot of typing and no thinking, and adding interactivity requires a lot of thinking and not a lot of typing. (From React docs)

- About Django project structure :  
Does my model contain methods that do more than managing database state? You should extract a command.  
Does my model contain properties that do not map to database fields? You should extract a query.  
Does my model reference infrastructure that is not my database (such as mail)? You should extract a command. 

- In JavaScript, there are six falsy values: false, 0, '' (empty string), null, undefined, and NaN. Everything else is truthy.

- Software, at the micro-level, challenges the common belief, "If you can't do it right the first time, when will you have time to do it over?" Experimentation is needed to determine what is "right" whether one does the experimentation in one's mind or by trying different versions of the code. It usually takes longer to get that mental model right and only have to type the code in once, then to try a version of the code and do it over as needed. -- WayneMack
